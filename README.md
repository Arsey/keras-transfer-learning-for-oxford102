# Keras pretrained models (currently only VGG16) + Transfer Learning for predicting classes in the Oxford 102 flower dataset

This bootstraps the training of deep convolutional neural networks with [Keras](https://keras.io/) to classify images in the [Oxford 102 category flower dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html).

To download the Oxford 102 dataset and prepare image files run

```bash
python bootstrap.py
